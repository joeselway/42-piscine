Outer loop dictates the number of ROWS (HORIZONTAL INTERATIONS) or the VERTICAL LENGTH which = y

Inner loop dictates the number of COLUMNS (VERTICAL INTERATIONS) for each ROW and the HORIZONTAL WIDTH which = x

input("x":vertical iterations/columns, "y": horizontal interations/rows)


outer loop: (# of rows, loop moves vertically down)

	inner loop: (# of columns, loop prints horizontally)

While y-counter <= y (loop columns until max for y is reached)					<------------ OUTER LOOP
	if column = (1 or H) (first or last)
		while column <= V (print until max for V is reached)			<------------ INNER LOOP A
			if (column = 1 or V) (first or last)
				print the o
			else
				print the -
	else
		while y-counter <= y (print until max for V is reached)					<------------	INNER LOOP B
